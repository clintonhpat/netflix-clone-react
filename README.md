## Reflection

  - This application was created in order to learn more front-end techniques, and more of a "full-stack" approach with minimal backend knowledge. The app was created utilizing React, Firebase, Stripe, and JSX and was initialized by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.

  - The technologies implemented in this project are React, Firebase, Stripe, Axios, React Router, React Hooks, JSX, and CSS. The `create-react-app` boilerplate was chosen to minimize initial setup time to invest more time into learning the structure of the codebases.
